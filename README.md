# Students Marks Analysis with Power BI

## Overview
This project utilizes the Power BI tool for the visualization and analysis of internal marks of 300 students. The visualizations provide insights into various aspects of the students' performance, including mean scores, trends in each subject, classification of students based on their scores, and identification of top performers.

## Key Metrics
- **Mean Scores:**
  - Mean score of girls
  - Mean score of boys
  - Mean score of all 300 students

- **Performance Classification:**
  - Number of students scoring above the mean
  - Number of students scoring above a specified threshold (e.g., 17, 15)

- **Subject Trends:**
  - Visualization of trends in each subject

- **Top Performers:**
  - Overall top 10 students
  - Top 10 students in each subject

## Visualization Details
- The visualizations provide clear insights into the distribution of scores among students and highlight trends in performance across different subjects.
- Various filters and classifications allow for detailed analysis, such as identifying students above a certain score threshold or comparing the performance of boys and girls.

## Usage
1. **Data Input:** Ensure that the dataset containing the internal marks of the 300 students is properly imported into Power BI.
2. **Visualization:** Navigate through the different visualizations to explore various metrics and insights.
3. **Filtering and Analysis:** Utilize filters and classifications to perform detailed analysis based on specific criteria.
4. **Exporting Results:** Export relevant visualizations or reports for further analysis or sharing with stakeholders.

## Note
- This project focuses on providing insights into students' academic performance based on internal marks data.
- Continuous updates and refinements may be made to improve the accuracy and relevance of the visualizations.
